# Software I Use

If a piece of software is important to my workflow, I try to have my [configuration](https://github.com/buckley-w-david/dotfiles) in my public dotfiles repository.

## Operating System

Currently I use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) as my main OS, and dual boot Windows 10 for games without Linux support that I want to play.

I'm interested in checking out [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) in the future, but have not yet devoted the time I would need to evaluate the switch.

## Window Manager

[xmonad](https://xmonad.org)

I avoid using Arch's package manager for xmonad due to their handling of Haskell packages constantly breaking my stuff.

I use stack, and generally followed [this](https://sitr.us/2018/05/13/build-xmonad-with-stack.html) post to help me set it up.

## Text Editing

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) mostly.

## Password Managment

I use [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).
