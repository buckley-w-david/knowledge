# Software I Use

If a piece of software is important to my workflow, I try to have my [configuration](https://github.com/buckley-w-david/dotfiles) in my public dotfiles repository.

## Operating System

Currently I use [Arch Linux](/software/arch.md) as my main OS, and dual boot Windows 10 for games without Linux support that I want to play.

I'm interested in checking out [NixOS](/software/nixos.md) in the future, but have not yet devoted the time I would need to evaluate the Switch.

## Window Manager

[xmonad](/software/xmonad.md)

## Text Editing

[Vim](/software/vim.md)

## Password Managment

[pass](/software/pass.md)
